  "neighborhood_guide": "Manhattan Beach is home to several distinct neighborhoods, each offering unique characteristics and appeal. The Sand Section, known for its proximity to the beach, is ideal for those seeking a vibrant, coastal lifestyle. Here, you'll find luxury homes with stunning ocean views and easy access to the Manhattan Beach Pier and downtown area.\n\nThe Tree Section is perfect for families, offering a suburban feel with tree-lined streets and spacious homes.
